https://ideas.repec.org/p/zbw/i4rdps/1.html,"The long-recognized spurious regressions problem can lead to mistaken inference in panel instrumental variables (IV) estimation. Spurious correlations arising from correlated cycles in finite time horizons can make irrelevant instruments appear strong with signable consequences for estimated IV coefficients, or interfere with valid of inference of causal effects from IV coefficients estimated using relevant instruments. The inclusion of time fixed effects in interacted specifications does not always resolve these problems. We demonstrate these concerns by revisiting recent studies of the causal origins of conflict. We offer diagnostic and corrective recommendations for avoiding the pitfalls arising from time series exhibiting persistence.",NA,NA,NA
https://ideas.repec.org/p/zbw/i4rdps/2.html,"Increasing evidence suggests that the reproducibility and replicability of scientific findings is threatened by researchers employing questionable research practices (QRP) in order to achieve publishable, positive and significant results. Numerous metrics have been developed to determine replication success but it has not yet been established how well those metrics perform in the presence of QRPs. This paper aims to compare the performance of different metrics quantifying replication success in the presence of four different types of QRPs: cherry picking, questionable interim analyses, questionable inclusion of covariates, and questionable subgroup analyses. Our results show that the metric based on the golden sceptical p-value does better in maintaining low values of overall type-I error rate, but often needs larger replication sample sizes, especially when severe QRPs are employed.",NA,NA,NA
https://ideas.repec.org/p/zbw/i4rdps/3.html,"Selective publication is among the most-cited reasons for widespread replication failures. I show in a simple model of the publication process that the replication rate is completely unresponsive to the suppression of insignificant results. I then show that the expected replication rate falls below its intended target owing to issues with common power calculations in replication studies, even in the absence of other factors such as p-hacking or heterogeneous treatment effects. I estimate an empirical model to evaluate if issues with power calculations alone are sufficient to explain the low replication rates observed in large-scale replication studies. The model produces replication rate predictions (using only data from original studies) that are almost identical to observed replication rates in experimental economics and social science. In psychology, the model explains two-thirds of the gap between the replication rate and its intended target. I conclude by discussing alternative measures of replication that are more responsive to selective publication.",NA,NA,NA

New econometric findings suggest this instrumental variables approach uses identifying variation not from the shifts, as previously believed, but rather from the shares and suggest a battery of checks to explore the sensitivity of estimates. In this note, I first replicate Hunt and Gauthier-Loiselle (2010) which estimates the effects of immigration on innovation via patenting, and second deploy these new checks from the econometric literature on shift-share instruments.

We assess the power of political science research by collating over 16,000 hypothesis tests from about 2,000 articles. Using generous assumptions, we find that the median analysis has about 10% power and that only about 1 in 10 tests have at least 80% power to detect the consensus effects reported in the literature. We also find substantial heterogeneity in tests across research areas, with some being characterized by high power but most having very low power.

Using their code, I reproduced their original findings, and did not find any notable coding errors while doing so. Then, taking advantage of the fact that Tsai et al. included several additional covariates beyond punishment in their experiment, I engaged in an extension of the original model, using the same method, to examine whether economic performance characteristics have indirect effects on evaluation through competence and morality as well. I found results that sug-gest that economic performance does have an indirect effect on preferences through competence and morality. I then tested the robustness of Tsai et al.'s original heterogeneous sensitivity tests by varying cut points on two demographic variables and found that their findings of a lack of heterogeneous sensitivity remain robust to different cut-points.

He also finds that elites and masses hold similar foreign policy attitudes after controlling for their demographic characteristics. In this replication report, we begin by running robustness and heterogeneity tests for the first claim. We find that the results survive many robustness tests. We also find, however, that only a small number of the these treatments significantly affected masses (N=28) or elites (N=30). This low rate suggests the possibility that almost all of these experiments failed to successfully manipulate either masses or elites. If so, we may not be able to conclude that masses and elites respond similarly to experiments with confidence until political scientists produce more experiments with actual treatment effects or with successful manipulation checks in cases of null effects.

This paper summarizes existing replication definitions and reviews how much economists replicate other scholars' work. We argue that in order to counter incentive problems potentially leading to a replication crisis, replications in the spirit of Merton's 'organized skepticism' are needed - what we call 'policing replications'.

To mitigate these problems and bolster research credibility, open data and preregistration practices have gained traction in the natural and social sciences. However, the extent of their adoption in different disciplines are unknown. We introduce procedures to identify the transparency of a research field using large-scale text analysis and machine learning classifiers. Using political science and international relations as an illustrative case, we examine 93,931 articles across the top 160 political science and international relations journals between 2010 and 2021.

https://ideas.repec.org/p/zbw/i4rdps/16.html,"This report presents a replication of Altindag et al. (2022) performed at the Olso Replication Games in 2022. Altindag et al. (2022) estimate the effects of an age-specific lockdown on mental health outcomes and mobility among adults aged 65 and older in Turkey, using a regression discontinuity design. The authors find a decline in mobility with a one-day decrease in the number of days being outside and an increase in the probability of never going out by 30 percentage points. These point estimates are statistically significant at the 1% level. The mobility restrictions lead to a worsening in mental health outcomes of approximately 0.2 standard deviations, statisti-cally significant at the 10% level in their preferred specification. In this paper we accomplish two things. First, we successfully reproduce Altindag et al.'s main findings. Second, we test the ro-bustness of the results to a small number of changes to their preferred estimations by (1) not clustering the standard errors on the running variable, (2) not including control variables, and (3) calculating the optimal bandwidth using another technique. Point estimates for mobility outcomes are stable to all three manipulations, and standard errors only change marginally. Point estimates and standard errors for the mental health outcomes are somewhat more sensitive, especially to changing the optimal bandwidth selection method. However, the observed changes are reason-ably expected when applying data-driven model selection methods to noisy data (to avoid over-fitting, it is likely preferable to apply a less data-driven approach like the original authors did). Our general impression is that the original analyses and results are both theoretically plausible and credible, despite some defensible model dependencies.",1,1,1

The ensuing emphasis on internal validity however has enabled the neglect of construct and external validity. This article develops a framework we call causal specification. The framework formally demonstrates the joint necessity of assumptions regarding internal, construct and external validity for causal generalization. Indeed, the lack of any of the three types of validity undermines the Credibility Revolution's own goal to understand causality deductively. Without assumptions regarding construct validity, one cannot accurately label the cause or outcome. Without assumptions regarding external validity, one cannot label the conditions enabling the cause to have an effect. These assumptions ultimately are founded on qualitative and theoretical understandings of a causal process.

We collect all RD-based findings published in top political science journals in the period 2009-2018. The distribution of published results exhibits pathological features; estimates tend to bunch just above the conventional level of statistical significance. A reanalysis of all studies with available data suggests that researcher discretion is not a major driver of these features. However, researchers tend to use inappropriate methods for inference, rendering standard errors artificially small.

The study also uses a regression design with district-level fixed effects to estimate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on voting for anti-establishment candidates during the US 2020 House primaries. It finds evidence that an increase in COVID cases was associated with a decline in voting for anti-establishment candidates in general, and for those endorsed by the Tea Party. We re-run the code for all tests in this paper, successfully reproducing its results in a preliminary replication. We then use the De Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille difference-in-differences estimator to replicate their main results, finding that though the coefficient remains negative, the results are not statistically significant. We also replicate their tests regarding US House primary candidates using a different measure of anti-establishment candidates. Here, we find that the interaction term between anti-establishment candidates and COVID-19 remain statistically significant, with the same sign. Finally, we employ an expanded dataset that includes Congressional primary candidates that were omitted in the initial dataset, as well as a re-coded extremism variable that also includes candidates endorsed by Donald Trump. These updated findings corroborate the paper's initial results.

Using lab and online experiments where subjects have to solve one policy-focused decision task and one non-focused background task, the authors show that increasing incentives or steering attention to the former led to higher attention spans, lower default adherence rates, and a higher choice quality in the decision task. However, because of steering participants focus to the decision task, lower choice quality and lower attention spans in the background task emerged as a consequence, which was particularly pronounced among individuals with lower cognitive capabilities and complex decision tasks. Essentially, the authors also describe that the negative effects in the background tasks offset the positive effects in the decision task, ultimately yielding a net-zero effect overall.

Based on elicited household characteristics, Douenne and Fabre (2022) estimate whether each household ""wins"" or ""loses"" from the carbon tax and dividend reform. They provide this binary (win vs. lose) information to households and subsequently ask households to evaluate whether they believe they would financially benefit from the policy. By exploiting the discontinuity in win vs. lose feedback, they assess the degree to which feedback affects subjective beliefs, finding that a household that is told it will ""win"" as a result of the reform increases its subjective belief that it will not lose by about 25 percentage points. The subset of households that is part of the Yellow Vests movement, however, revises its subjective belief of not losing upwards by only 10 percentage points after being told that it will ""win"" from the carbon tax reform.

In short, the experiments randomized whether a bill was selected for discussion among a bi-partisan legislative caucus. The paper then measures and reports the corresponding effects of that discussion around the bill.

Moreover, Republican women recruit a significantly larger share of co-sponsors from the rival party than Republican men, whereas the opposite is true among Democrats.

Consistent with this, we find no evidence that pre-registration in itself reduces p-hacking and publication bias. (b) When pre-registration is accompanied by a PAP we find evidence consistent with both reduced phacking and publication bias.",NA,NA,NA

Variation in such choices across studies leads to heterogeneity in results that introduce an additional layer of uncertainty not accounted for in reported standard errors and confi dence intervals. We provide a framework for studying heterogeneity in the social sciences and divide heterogeneity into population heterogeneity, design heterogeneity, and analytical heterogeneity. We estimate each type's heterogeneity from multi-lab replication studies, prospective meta-analyses of studies varying experimental designs, and multi-analyst studies. Our results suggest that population heterogeneity tends to be relatively small, whereas design and analytical heterogeneity are large. A conservative interpretation of the estimates suggests that incorporating the uncertainty due to heterogeneity would approximately double sample standard errors and confi dence intervals. We illustrate that heterogeneity of this magnitude-unless properly accounted for-has severe implications for statistical inference with strongly increased rates of false scientifi c claims.",NA,NA,NA

First, there is a strong and positive association between family members' preferences, even when controlling for personality traits and family background. Second, families can be grouped into two clusters: approximately 20% of the families are characterized by relatively impatient, risk-averse, and spiteful members, while the rest of the families have relatively patient, risk-tolerant, and prosocial members. Recognizing the pivotal role of cluster analysis in deriving the second result, we first successfully computationally reproduced the results, and then we conducted two types of robustness checks. The first examines the transformation of variables (continuous or categorical), affecting the proximity measure that is crucial to cluster analysis. The second assesses the effect of varying the number of clusters on the findings. Some results are robust, as we consistently find the small cluster of families identified by Chowdhury et al. (2022). However, divergent outcomes emerge with categorical variables (a logical choice given their nature) and a larger number of clusters (3 or 4).

Third, we test the robustness of the results to 5,511 re-analyses. We find a robustness reproducibility of about 70%.

The data error is a result of including fixed effects for the string variable 'city'. The raw variable is case sensitive and has many spelling mistakes. The coding error involves assigning a value of zero for the variable ""of color"" to both individuals identified as 'white' and as 'other' in the raw data.

Treated firms are firms located in countries that do not receive free allowances anymore. Control firms are firms located in countries that continue to receive free allowances. The main analysis is led at the firm level using annual data from 2009 to 2017. Two way fixed effects estimators are combined with 1 to 1 matching to estimate the impact of the treatment on firms' emissions.

The point estimates are statistically significant at the 5% level using Conley SEs either at the genetic distance or geographical distance level. Second, a historical analysis shows that one additional century of exposure to the Western Church increased the probability of a city being a commune by 12.2 and is statistically significant at the 1% level using Conley SEs with distance cutoffs of 500km or 2,500 km.

(2023) coin the concept of 'strategic descriptive representation'. When facing electoral struggles, PRRP would exploit the existing gender gap and strategically increase the descriptive representation of women to attract female votes and fare better in the election. Using data on 58 elections across 19 countries, the authors test their argument and find conclusive evidence supporting it. In this paper, we offer a replication of the study. First, we assess the numerical reproducibility of the published findings ('verification'). Second, we investigate the 'robustness' of the findings and evaluate the results under alternative model specifications. While our replication study identifies minor issues with the verification and some of themodel specifications, itmost importantly shows that the main results of the paper are driven by a single outlier. The paper's key finding is hence contingent on the inclusion of a single observation (French Front National in 2012), which is a questionable observation as it only elected two MPs, one of whom was a woman. Additionally, this woman's election was seemingly caused by a combination of idiosyncratic factors discussed in the study. Once the case is excluded from the analysis the key model parameter shrinks close to zero and loses its statistical significance. Accordingly, in light of our findings, there is no clear evidence supporting strategic descriptive representation and electoral pressures do not seem sufficient to encourage PRRP to increase their share of female representatives. Correcting this empirical finding has important implications for both understanding PRRP's electoral strategies and women's representation.",,,

First, we successfully computationally reproduce the main claims of the paper in STATA. Second, we reproduce the results in R, including producing the analysis data from scratch. Third, we test the robustness of the results by checking the identification assumption with new data, applying different standard errors for the main estimation, and using an alternative empirical model specification.",1,1,1

The paper identifies a carbon tax shock and uses it to quantify the effect of a permanent unexpected increase in the carbon tax rate. The effect of this increase is obtained using a policy counterfactual exercise based on dynamic effects estimated using panel local projections. We use the authors' own Stata replication package to reproduce the main results of the paper and carry out additional robustness tests. We also conduct these empirical analyses using popular open-source econometric libraries in R. We compare the original permanent carbon tax increase policy counterfactual impulse responses to standard one-time carbon tax shock impulse responses. The justification for this robustness test is that carbon tax rate changes are persistent, so that a transitory shock effectively mimics a permanent shock. We find that (1) the authors' replication package successfully reproduces the results of the paper; (2) alternative local projection specifications and policy counterfactuals largely exhibit the same qualitative properties as the main results of the paper.",1,1,1

The estimate is statistically significant at the 5% level. These effects are driven by dissatisfaction with money losses rather than more antagonistic attitudes towards environmental protection. In this report, we inspect the data and replication package of the paper with two sets of exercises. First, we successfully computationally reproduce all the main results of the paper. Second, we test the robustness of the authors' main results by exploring different definitions of control variables, variations in the regression specifications, and alternative econometric models and research designs.

In general, we are able to reproduce their findings, despite a minor coding error and some missing information. We test the robustness of their results by comparing average and median response times and choices, separating the sample into quick and slow respondents, including additional controls, and different estimation parameters. We do not find differences between choices between slow and quick respondents, somewhat contradicting their conclusions. Moreover, most subjects played faster as the game was repeated.

These results persist when considering the ideological underpinnings of each issue, elite partisanship, the relevance of partisanship in profession, elite professional community, and elite trust in partisan information sources. We attempt to reproduce these findings through three methods. First, we run the data analysis code as it was provided by the authors and successfully reproduced the paper's main findings. Second, we test the robustness of the results by generating estimates of public opinion from a separate nationally representative survey administered at the same time as the authors' survey.

Findings reveal that identity cues significantly influence how individuals form opinions and engage with online content, accounting for 28% to 61% of variation in voting associated with commenters' production, reputation, and reciprocity. The results highlight the role of identity cues in perpetuating social content evaluation disparities and suggest anonymized content votes could enhance overall content quality on social platforms. In the replication analysis of this study, we utilized the provided script on the same data, which was provided by the paper's author following non-disclosure agreements. Further the robustness of the results was also tested after applying a mixed effects model instead of the linear probability model. Our replication confirmed the overall reproducibility of the results using the provided script, but there were notable changes in the estimates. In our analysis, the variation in individuals forming opinions and engaging with online content, as measured by voting associated with commenters' production, reputation, and reciprocity, ranged from 15% to 60% due to identity cues. This indicates that a few effects are somewhat smaller than in the original study. Moreover, when using our alternative analytic approach, the results remained generally robust, but there were exceptions. Specifically, the model assessing the impact of identity cues on individuals in voting associated with commenters' production yielded different results: We generally found stronger evidence in form of higher statistical significance for the claims of the authors.",1,1,1

The original study uses a quasi-experimental design, employing temporal and sectional matching methods to compare deforestation rates before and after IL designation, concluding an average reduction of -0.05% in deforestation. To verify these findings, we conducted three main tests: a logit analysis, the consideration of negative deforestation values in the Atlantic Forest, and the synthetic control method. The logit analysis assessed the relationship between IL designation and covariates like land size, elevation, slope, and proximity to urban centers, confirming that these factors significantly influence IL designation, consistent with the original study. We also examined the treatment of negative deforestation values in the Atlantic Forest, originally treated as zero. By retaining these values, we found no significant impact on the study's overall results, indicating that the original methodological choice did not affect the main conclusions. Finally, the synthetic control method was used to replicate the counterfactual analysis of IL-designated areas, demonstrating that these areas consistently exhibited lower deforestation rates compared to the synthetic control post-2011. These tests confirmed the original study's findings, demonstrating that the formal designation of ILs contributes to small but significant reductions in deforestation, supporting the effectiveness of ILs as a strategy for environmental conservation and indigenous rights protection.

In this study we look at the reproducibility of the work and the robustness of the results across two dimensions - the strength of the empirical results and the robustness of the estimation methodology. Across the empirical dimension, we extend the model with data past the global pandemic and study the robustness of the results before 2020 as well as the strength of the conclusion after 2020.

https://ideas.repec.org/p/zbw/i4rdps/175.html,"Zhang (2023) used an online, pre-registered, large-scale controlled experiment to test the effect of an endorsement of Joe Biden by the scientific journal Nature on several perceptual and behavioural outcomes. The main results of the paper were the following: the endorsement of Biden caused a large reduction in Trump supporters' trust in Nature and a considerably smaller reduction in their 'trust in US scientists'. The estimated effects are larger for individuals who, prior to the treatment, believed that Nature was unlikely to have endorsed a presidential candidate. The endorsement also made Trump supporters less likely to request COVID and vaccine related information from the endorsing journal. For Biden supporters, the respective estimated effects were generally positive, but small and insignificant. In his abstract, the author summarizes his key causal claim as follows: ""political endorsement by scientific journals can undermine and polarize public confidence in the endorsing journals and the scientific community"" (p.696). In this replication study, we computationally reproduced all results, with few and trivial exceptions. We then tested the robustness of those results that gave rise to Zhang's (2023) main causal claim. These tests include an alternative estimation method, an alternative way to capture support for the candidates, and a series of heterogeneity analyses by demographics. All test results support the author's findings but add interesting nuance. Some of our tests exploit variables from the raw data that were not included in the clean, published dataset, but the author willingly provided: a post-treatment 'manipulation check' that asked respondents to indicate the candidate that Nature actually endorsed, and data on requests for COVID related articles from other outlets besides Nature. We used these variables to conduct an Instrumental Variables (IV) procedure and test a 'causal mediation' model. Overall, and for Trump supporters in particular, our report corroborates the author's main finding of a strong negative effect of the endorsement on the overall perception of the endorser (Nature).

In a natural experiment leveraging conscription for a 1920s Peruvian highway designed to replicate a pre-colonial road system (Qhapaq Ãan), Carter finds through a geographic regression discontinuity design that eligibility for state conscription increased the likelihood of a municipality having an indigenous movement by about 30 percentage points (approximately .75 standard deviations) and scores on an omnibus accommodation measure by about .3 items (approximately .4 standard deviations). The omnibus measure includes the number of institutions that an indigenous community reports preserving (increased by .3 items on a 7 point scale, or .25 standard deviations), likelihood of having a communal land title (increased by 12 percentage points, or .3 standard deviations), and likelihood of registration with the government (increased by 9 percentage points, or .3 standard deviations). All point estimates are significant at the .1% level. We successfully computationally reproduce all main claims of the paper but find inconsistencies between the map of the road presented by Carter and that used by Franco et al. (2021) that affect its passage through a small number of municipalities. In order to investigate whether these municipalities drive the main findings without the ability to identify municipalities in the data, we drop municipalities iteratively and re-run the analysis, finding only minor changes in coefficient estimates across subsets. In addition, we explore a number of sensitivity analyses for the regression discontinuity design that vary the functional form, vary the bandwidth window, and use the Rosenbaum method for window selection. While the results remain consistent under all analyses, we recommend for further research to recode treated municipalities on the basis of the alternative road map and explore the as-if random assumption in light of evidence linking proximity to the precolonial road to various economic and political outcomes.",1,1,1

Second, personal ties are particularly relevant during periods of domestic threat. Third, combat experience only matters during periods of foreign threat. We successfully replicate all main results with Mattingly's (2024) database, only identifying minimal differences in calculated standard errors when employing Stata instead of R.

Jetter and Swasito confirm the core results are computationally replicable. To extend the results, they use alternative data sources to measure foreign and domestic threat. They conclude that the domestic threat results in particular are not robust to the alternative data source they use. I raise questions about the quality of this alternative data source. I also ask whether, even if the data were of higher quality, it would map onto the core concept. Finally, I argue for the importance of substantive knowledge of the case and qualitative scoring of the foreign and domestic threat variable. However, the points raised by Jetter and Swasito in their replication effort are important and well-taken. Measuring concepts such as foreign and domestic threat is challenging, and doing so is a potential avenue for future quantitative research.",NA,NA,NA

The demand estimates are sensitive to a 30% cost-share threshold pursued when con- structing input price based IVs. 3.

I focus primarily on point 2, where my interpretation of their results differs slightly from their own.

Our findings reveal a trade-off between factors enhancing publication in top journals and those driving citation impact.

Instead, papers focusing on central concepts tend to receive more citations once published. However, papers with intricate, interconnected causal narratives-measured by the complexity and depth of causal channels-are more likely to be both published in top journals and receive more citations.
